                                                                                     "The Blogs of HTTP"


Introduction:
             HTTP stand for hyper text transfer protocol which is used in client-side communication.
             By using HTTP, the user/client can sent a request to the server and the server will sent a response back 
             to the user/client.
             They are several different development of HTTP but in this blog we mainly focusing on HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2.


--> HTTP 1.1:
             HTTP 1.1 was created in 1997, If you make a request to the server for specific url like www.zenClass.html page and the server response back the url to you
             before sending request and the response there is a TCP connection which established between the client and server. Again if you make a request to the server 
             for some like url like www.zenClass.image.img page and the server response you back the url with image data.The connection was not lost here because we added 
             keep live header which is the part of the request so there is a open connection between the client and server. There is a persistent connection like the request 
             and the response are merged in a single line.these are the drawbacks of the http 1.1 protocol.
               * The first issue is its transfer the request and the response in a single text format
               * The second issue is is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not receive.

--> HTTP 2  :
             HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format.
            it works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests. HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. it compresses
            the header. The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.

                                             * It works on the textual format.	                                      * It works on the binary protocol.
                                    * There is head of line blocking that blocks all 
                                    the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.	                * It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
                                    * It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages	            * It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
                                         * It compresses data by itself.	                                          * It uses HPACK for data compression.
