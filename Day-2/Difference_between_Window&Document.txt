                                                       Difference Between Window and Document Object

Window object :- 
               Window object is the main javascript object root, like it is a global object in the browser. It is purely has browser functionality.
               
               Well, the window is the first thing that gets loaded in the browser. This window object has properties likes length, innerWidth, innerHeight,
               name, parent,etc..

               Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each <iframe> element has its own window object too, which is nested inside the window.

               Each of the window gets its own separate global object.

               Thus, the window.window always refer to the window object but the window.parent and window.top might refer to the enclosing window, which giving 
               access to the other execution context.

               Window object has properties like browser history, location and the deviceâ€™s screen etc. In case of multi tab browser, a window object represents 
               a single tab, but some of its properties like innerHeight, innerWidth and methods like resizeTo() will affect the whole browser window.

               some other properties are,
                    -> setTimeout() & setInterval() ---- event handler to timer
                    -> location ---- giving the current URL
                    -> navigator ---- describing the browser software

Document Object :- 
                 Document is the main object of the Document object model (DOM).

                 The document object is that is your HTML, ASPX, PHP or other document that will be loaded into the browser.

                 The document gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookies, etc..

                 This means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property and if it is document then it is window.document property.

                 The document object represents the whole html document as a tree of Objects(HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags). It is the root element that 
                 represents the html document.

                 Each window object has a document object to be rendered. These objects gets confused in past because HTML elements are added to the global object
                 when assigned to a unique ID. 
                                             EX :- 
                                                <body>
                                                   <p id="para"> This is a paragraph </p>
                                                </body>

                                        These element can be refer by,
                                          -> window.para (or) window["para"]
                                          -> window.getElementById("para")
                                          -> window.querySelector("para")
                                          -> document.body.child;
